# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to look at this. Here's how to contribute:

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. Make your changes with clear, focused commits
3. Test your changes before submitting
4. Open a pull request with a short description of what changed and why

## Commit Messages

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
- `feat:` — new feature
- `fix:` — bug fix
- `docs:` — documentation changes
- `chore:` — maintenance tasks
- `test:` — adding or updating tests
- `refactor:` — code changes that don't fix a bug or add a feature

## Code Style

- Keep changes small and focused
- Comment the why, not the what
- If you're fixing a bug, include a test that would have caught it

## Issues

Open an issue before starting large changes. Describe the problem you're solving.

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the MIT License.
